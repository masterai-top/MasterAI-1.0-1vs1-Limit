# MasterAI-1.0-1vs1-Limit

## Introduction

MasterAI is an AI poker dedicated to suport n-play (single- or multi-agent) Texas Hold'em imperfect-informatin games. It has been achieving exceptionally good results by using its propretary algorithm. In September 2020, it defeated 14 top human poker professionals. 

## Technology

MasterAI is developed by two components: offline component and online component:
* An offline component solves random poker situations (public states along with probability vectors over private hands for both players) and uses them to train a neural network. After training, this neural network can accurately predict the value for each player of holding each possible hand at a given poker situation.

* An online component uses the continuous re-solving algorithm to dynamically select an action for MasterAI to play at each public state during the game. This algorithm solves a depth-limited lookahead using the neural network to estimate values at terminal states.

The MasterAI strategy approximates a Nash Equilibrium, with an approximation error that depends on the neural network error and the solution error of the solver used in continuous re-solving.

## Prerequisites

Running any of the MasterAI code requires [torch](http://torch.ch/).
Torch is only officially supported based on *Linux systems. [This page](https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Windows)
contains suggestions for using torch on a Windows machine
